We have 4 published Jupyter notebooks.

1 contains the code used to develop the preliminary model, in which we include most variables in the training dataset to help select variables for potential inclusion in a final model.
2 contains the code used for hyperparamater optimzation and model architecture selection.
3 contains the code/results for the final XGBoost-based model.
4 contains the code for the subanalysis across 4 different sociodemographic groups and 4 ISS cohorts.
